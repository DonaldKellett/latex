Let $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ be a sequence of independent and
identically distributed random variables with
$\operatorname{E}[X_i]=\mu$ and $\operatorname{Var}[X_i]=\sigma^2<\infty$,
and let

\begin{equation*}
S_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n X_i
\end{equation*}

denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the
random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n-\mu)$ converge in
distribution to a normal $N(0,\sigma^2)$.
